# Contents

1 - JavaScript File (app.js): This simple JS file demonstrates how a Node.js application can utilize Docker volumes to persist data outside the container.
2 - Dockerfile: This file contains the instructions to build a Docker image that runs the Node.js application. It shows how to set up the working directory and copy 
    necessary files into the container.
3 - package.json: This file lists the dependencies required for the Node.js application, including nodemon for easier development.
4 - Images: The PNG files provide visual explanations of the Docker volume and mount concepts and practical steps.

# Conclusion

This repository is a practical guide to understanding and using Docker volumes and mounts. It provides a hands-on example with all the necessary files and visual aids to help you get started with Docker data persistence. Additionally, nodemon is used to streamline the development process by automatically restarting the application when changes are detected.
